## How to set up
Ensure that you have git installed. Also ensure that you have Unity 2021.3.17f1 installed. Later versions may work as well, but that is the version the game was developed in. We have not tested it in other versions. Be sure to clone the repository into a desired folder. 
Open the project using unity hub. It may prompt you to install some extra things if it is your first time using Unity hub. The first open will take much longer than the rest due to Unity downloading necessary files. 

## How to play test
Unity hub should open the game to the main menu screen. YOU NEED TO START FROM THIS SCENE. If it does not open this screen, you can find it at Project 1/Assets/Scenes/MainMenu.unity.

From here you have the option to either play a new game, load your previous save, check the instructions or quit the game. Your character will now spawn in the middle of the map to. Utilize WASD keys to move, and use your mouse cursor to aim your bullets. Enemies will spawn at different spots in the map and chase you. When they make contact with you, you will lose health, indicated at the bottom left. When you kill an enemy, they will drop an orb which will increase your character's experience and score. Once you reach 0 health, the game will end
